# Scroll Fixer for Google Calendar


Inspired by [Ivan Morgillo's Google Calendar Scroll Disabler](https://github.com/alter-ego/google-calendar-scroll-disabler) after reading [this forum post](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/O2fpZq36otA).

This Chrome Extension disables the scroll on the month view in Google Calendar.  You will have to use the arrows `<` `>` buttons to change months.
